2.	I created this Github when I started classes at Wake Technical College in Raleigh, North Carolina and primarily use it for educational purposes.
3.	I created this repository with my name. I created this so that I would gain a better understanding of GitHub.
4.	In order to clone this repository,  I created the repository in the web browser at first, downloaded GitHub for desktops and then opened the specific repository and pressed “clone”. When I downloaded Github, I had to change my security settings in order to be able to use it.
